2. `find / -iname "*file*name"`

   This command helps in finding files by its approximate name inside the directory you chose. This is useful if a user is not sure whether how they capitalized the letters of their file.

 **Ex 1.**

   This example shows that though I typed `*Pmed*` as my file name input, it showed every file that contains `pmed` in its file name.

 **Ex 2.**

   Just like example 1, though I typed `*JOURNAL*` as my file name input, it showed every file that contains `journal` in its file name.

3. `find / -type *type*`

   This command helps display a sort of any type inside a directory. This is useful if a user wants to see the elements inside their directory.

 **Ex 1.**

![Image](findtype1.jpg)

   This example shows that by using the letter `d` which stands for directory, it displays every possible directory inside `.\technical`.

 **Ex 2.**

![Image](findtype2.1.jpg)
![Image](findtype2.2.jpg)

   This example shows that by using the letter `f` which stands for files, it displays every file inside `.\technical`.

4. `find / -empty`
   This command displays if a file is empty, or displays all the empty files inside a directory.
  
 **Ex 1.**

![Image](findempty1.jpg)

   This example shows every empty file in `./technical`. Since every file has something in it, the output is nothing.
  
 **Ex 2.**
 
 ![Image](findempty2.jpg)
 
   This example shows if Server.java is empty. Since it is not empty, the output is nothing.
